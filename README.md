# Weather forecasting for Kraków
> The aim of this programme is to forecast average monthly temperature for Kraków, basing on provided observational dataset.
Undoubtedly, machine learning is an ideal way to evaluate time series included this one. 

## General info
The problem is to predict the average value of monthly temperature for Kraków. The dataset provides the monthly temperature from January 2007 to August 2018.

It is credited to Institute of Meteorology and Water Management, Poland. 

The dataset has been downloaded as a CSV file with the filename "Krakow_2007_2018.csv".
